when he tried, the dryad inside the tree chased him away. So, when the
dryad was washing her hair in the river, the giant tried again. He
reached out to pick an orange, but was rewarded only with a terrible
thorn driven deep into his finger. The dryad relented, seeing the giant's
sadness, and gave him an orange and sent him on his way. This spear
was made from the wood of the long-dead dryad.
